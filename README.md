# Data Analysis with Least Squares and Monte Carlo

**What is least squares method?**
<br/>
The method of least squares is a standard approach in regression analysis to approximate the solution of overdetermined systems by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals made in the results of each individual equation. The most important application is in data fitting.
<br/>

**What is optimization minimization?**
<br/>
An optimization problem involves minimizing a function (called the objective function) of several variables, possibly subject to restrictions on the values of the variables defined by a set of constraints.
<br/>

**What is the purpose of this program?**
<br/>
Here we both apply these two methods and compare the two methods.

**About the Dataset**
<br/>
Data obtained from an experiment were analyzed. For a race car moving in a tunnel, the following drag forces are measured with respect to the indicated velocity. You can enter or import your own dataset.
